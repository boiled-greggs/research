The program static is written in Fortran 77 with rather simple
MPI calls.  It therefore requires a Fortran 77 compiler.  If you
are going to run this in parallel mode you also need to have
MPI installed.  For single processor use you can use our mpifake.[fh]
files to make the program think that it is using MPI.  See mpifake.f,
mpifake.h, and the makefiles for more details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT:

To reduce the size of the code in multiple processor runs, edit the
line

      parameter (minproc=1)

to the minimum number of processors you plan to use.  Note that
the program will stop if you try to use fewer than minproc processors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In serial mode static should run on any machine with a
Fortran 77 compiler.  It is known to run on the following
architectures:

Intel 486 and above running Linux and the Absoft F77 compiler

Intel 486 and above running Linux and using g77

Dec Alpha or Compaq SC using the Dec Fortran compiler

IBM SPx in serial, using xlf compiler

SGI Origin 2000

The code has NOT been shown to run using the GNU g77 Fortran
compiler.  At least one version of this compiler does not compile
the complex arithmetic sections of the LAPACK library correctly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In parallel mode the code is known to run on the:

IBM SPx using the xlf compiler and MPI

SGI Origin 2000 using MPI

Dec Alpha or Compaq SC using the Dec Fortran compiler

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile this code, find the appropriate makefile from the
list 'ls makefile.*' and copy it to makefile.  Edit the P1
file appropriately and compile using the "make" command.
You can either copy the appropriate makefile.* to "makefile",
or use, e.g.
			make -f makefile.sgi
if you are running on an Silicon Graphics Origin.

Here are the currently available makefiles and options:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Linux serial machines:

If you are going to use the ALTAS libraries
(http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/), edit the "NLIBS=" line in the
makefile to point to the appropriate directory.

Using the g77 compiler on a Linux machine:

make -f makefile.g77

with the ATLAS libraries:

make -f makefile.g77 newblas

Using the Absoft compiler on a Linux machine:

make -f makefile.absoft

with the ATLAS libraries:

make -f makefile.absoft newblas

Using the Intel compiler

make -f makefile.intel

This will produce an inordinate number of warnings, but the code
will run.  Note that we have yet to figure out how link the ATLAS
libraries with the Intel object files.

On an IBM SP:

In serial mode:

make -f makefile.aix.single

In parallel mode:

make -f makefile.aix.parallel

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

On an SGI Origin 2000:

Parallel Mode, SGI libraries for BLAS and LAPACK (recommended)

make -f makefile.sgi

Parallel Mode, lapack.f for BLAS and LAPACK

make -f makefile.sgi parnlb

Serial Mode, SGI libraries for BLAS and LAPACK

make -f makefile.sgi scrlib

Serial Mode, lapack.f for BLAS and LAPACK

make -f makefile.sgi scrnlb

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

On an Compaq or DEC Alpha Origin 2000:

Parallel Mode, Compaq libraries for BLAS and LAPACK (recommended)

make -f makefile.alpha

Parallel Mode, lapack.f for BLAS and LAPACK

make -f makefile.alpha parnlb

Serial Mode, Compaq libraries for BLAS and LAPACK

make -f makefile.alpha scrlib

Serial Mode, lapack.f for BLAS and LAPACK

make -f makefile.alpha scrnlb

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are switching between machines, or from serial to parallel
on the same machine, please do a

	make -f makefile.absoft clean

to make sure that none of the previous object files survive.  (You
don't have to use the Absoft makefile, of course.)
