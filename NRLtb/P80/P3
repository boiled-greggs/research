c
c     nkd is the maximum number of k-points in the irreducible part of
c      the Brillouin zone used in the calculation
c
      integer nkd
      parameter (nkd = 5000)
c
c     nopd is the maximum number of space group operations for the
c      current group.  Since 48 is the maximum for a 3-d lattice, and
c      there is only a small size penalty, we usually keep nopd = 48.
c
      integer nopd
      parameter (nopd=48)
c
c     minproc is the lower bound on the number of processors in the
c      current run.  Trying to run a job with fewer processors will
c      generate an error message and abort the run.  This means
c      that minproc must be set to 1 for scalar computing.
c
      integer minproc
      parameter (minproc=1)
c
c     nkdproc is then the number of k-points allotted to each processor,
c      correcting for rounding:
c
      integer nkdproc
      parameter (nkdproc = nkd/minproc + 1)
c
c     nwdd is the number of energy "windows".  This concept is inherited
c      from the LAPW k-point generation code, and will be removed in a
c      future version of the program.  "1" is always correct in the TB
c      calculation.
c
      integer nwdd
      parameter (nwdd=1)
