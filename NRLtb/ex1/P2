c
c     These are the parameters which set up arrays for the calculation
c      of eigenvectors.  Note that eigenvectors are not needed for all
c      calculations, in which case you should set
c      meigen = mtorque = mpress = 0.
c
c=======================================================================
c
c     If you are going to do a pressure calculation, set mpress = 1.
c      Otherwise, you can set mpress = 0 to make the size of the
c      eigenvector matrix in bande small.  This will be useful only
c      for large atom calculations.  The program should catch any
c      inconsistencies (e.g., asking for pressure but setting
c      mpress = 0)
c
      integer mpress
      parameter (mpress = 1)
c
c     When doing calculations using non-collinear magnetization it is
c     often useful to know the torque on each spin.  If you are doing
c     calculations of the torque you will need to set mtorque = 1 on the
c     line below.  Note that the code will check any inconsistencies.
c
      integer mtorque
      parameter (mtorque = 0)
c
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c
c     Alternatively, you might want to know the magnitude and direction
c      of the output spin on each atom.  If so, set msdir = 1 below.
c      Again, this is a non-collinear calculation, so you must have
c      mcol = 2 in P1.
c
      integer msdir
      parameter (msdir = 0)
c
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c
c     Certain calculations, particularly the charge-density decompostion
c      calculations for QLMT runs, require knowledge of the individual
c      eigenstates.  Set meigen = 1 if you need this, meigen = 0 if you
c      don't.  The program should refuse to run if meigen is set wrong.
c
c     Note that pressure calculations need the eigenstates, hence both
c      meigen and mpress must be 1 if you want the pressure.
c
c     Also note that the torque calculations need the eigenvalues, so
c      meigen must be 1 if mtorque = 1.
c
      integer meigen
      parameter (meigen = 1)
c
c=======================================================================
c
c     Though you may want to change some of the parameters below
c      the recommended values are good ones for most problems.  Please
c      do not change anything below this line unless you have a good
c      reason.
c
c     Note that the parameters defined here assume the definition of
c      other parameters in the P1 file.
c
c     Version 1.30 and above:  we need to double the number of
c      basis functions when doing a non-collinear magnetization
c      calculation.  This requires mcol=2 in P1.
c
c     mhe is the dimension of the eigenvectors for use in things like
c      orbital decomposition of the eigenstates.  If not needed,
c      (meigen = 0 above) we want to make this as small as possible.
c      The following trick should do it, without making compilation
c      difficult or machine dependent:
c
      integer mhe
      parameter (mhe = mcol*(meigen*mbas*(matom-1) + mbas))
c
c     Similar calculation for pressure:
c
      integer mhp
      parameter (mhp = mcol*(mpress*mbas*(matom-1) + mbas))
