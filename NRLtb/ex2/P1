c
c     Many parameters are scale with the number of atoms, natom
c     In the following we assume we need s, p, and d orbitals
c      for every atom, and that there are 4 parameters for each
c      onsite term
c
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c
c     version 1.11:
c
c     Modified to explicitly type all of these parameters as integer,
c      in case some subroutines (e.g., setparv.f) use integer none
c                                                    mjm -- 23 July 1999
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c
c     version 1.30:
c
c     Includes a new variable, mcol, which redimensions the secular
c      equation set size (mh) to handle non-collinear magnetization
c      (mcol = 2) or only collinear magnetization (mcol = 1).
c                                                  mjm -- 14 August 2000
c=======================================================================
c
c     The parameters in this section determine the number of atom types,
c      atoms, k-points, and basis functions.  These may be changed
c      as needed to fit the problem.
c
c     Note that this version of the code eliminates the structure
c      dimension
c
c     mkind is the maximum number of atom species in the parameter file
c
c     For now we'll assume the system is binary.  The input routine
c      input.f is smart enough to figure out that the system is
c      only monatomic.
c
      integer mkind
      parameter (mkind=2)
c
c     matom is the maximum number of atoms in the system
c
      integer matom
      parameter (matom= 30)
c
c     mbas is the basis set size per atom:  1 for s, 4 for sp, 9 for spd
c       If you are doing atom types with differing basis sets use
c       your best judgement on how to dimension this.
c
      integer mbas
      parameter (mbas = 4)
c
c     mppair is a guess at the average number of pairs formed by
c      each atom in the unit cell.  Remember that we've removed
c      the double counting of pairs:
c
      integer mppair
      parameter (mppair = 600)
c
c     mspin is the maximum number of spins.  Should be 1
c      for paramagnetic calculations, or 2 if spin-polarized
c      calculations are contemplated.  mspin=2 will eat up memory
c      for non-polarized calculations, but shouldn't hurt anything.
c      If the parameter file is spin polarized, i.e., it starts
c      "NM000xx" or "OM000xx", then you must have mspin = 2.
c
      integer mspin
      parameter (mspin = 1)
c
c     Set mcol = 1 if you are NOT going to be doing non-collinear spin
c      calculations.  Set mcol = 2 if you ARE going to do non-collinear
c      spin calculations.  Note that this doubles the basis set size,
c      see the variable "mh" defined below.
c
      integer mcol
      parameter (mcol = 2)
c
c=======================================================================
c
c     Though you may want to change some of the parameters below
c      the recommended values are good ones for most problems.  Please
c      do not change anything below this line unless you have a good
c      reason.
c
c     (DO NOT CHANGE NPARD!)
c
c     Change to include the new cross-atom on-site terms:
c
      integer npard
      parameter (npard = mkind*(29+68*mkind))
c
c     mint is the number of types of interaction.  I.e., if we mkind
c      = 3, we have A-A, B-B, C-C, A-B, A-C, B-C type interactions
c
      integer mint
      parameter (mint = mkind*(mkind+1)/2)
c
c     This is the dimension of the secular equation for this problem:
c
      integer mh
      parameter (mh=mcol*mbas*matom)
c
c     mptype = 2 means monatomic systems,
c     mptype = 3 means multi-atom-type systems (3 works for monatomic systems)
c
      integer mptype, mnn, mpkind
      parameter (mptype=3,mnn=1,mpkind=14)
c
c     mpair scales with matom if the unit cell size
c      is on the order or greater than the cutoff distance
c
      integer mpair
      parameter (mpair=mppair*matom)
