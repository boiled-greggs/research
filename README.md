Exploration of Electronic Properties using Python Tight-Binding (PythTB)

Currently studying the properties of several different schwarzites, nanotubes, and a novel bilayer graphene structure featuring coalescence of the two layers with a hole. The latter nanomesh structure is of particular interest.
